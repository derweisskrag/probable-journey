# College Homeworks collection for the Spring semester

We have the following courses:

1. Algorithms and Data structures
2. Theory of probability and statistics
3. Discrete mathematics

## Purpose of this repository on GitHub

During these courses, we must solve home assignments, therefore, I need to publish my code here for the teacher to review it comfortably without the need to download any of my scripts<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: Footnote content goes here.



## Algorithms and Data structures

This course covers the fundamental aspects of programming aspects. This means that there are no advanced data structures such as KD-trees (pseudo-balanced) or K-D-B-trees (KD-trees with balancing functionality), as well as Red-black-trees, Quadtrees, Space Spatial trees, XOR Linked Lists, and other. Instead, the course focuses on the basics:

- Linked lists:
    1. Doubly-linked lists
    2. Cyclid-linked lists
- Queues:
    1. Dequeue
    2. Priority queues
- Sequences:
    1. Arrays
    2. Lists
    3. Sets
- Stacks
- Heaps:
    1. MinHeap
    2. MaxHeap
- Trees:
    1. Binary trees
    2. AVL trees
- Graphs

Behind each data structure, there are reasons why we would use them in practice. For example, Balanced RBTree allows us to search for `O(log n)` in terms of time complexity. It is efficient. It is noteworthy that ***the Binary search*** algorithm is efficient and performs at the logarithmic time complexity for arrays. However, the sequence must be sorted for this algorithm.

**NB!** There are abstract data structures such as *SEQUENCE*, and there are their implementation ***for the specific range of tasks***. 

## Theory of probability and statistics 

This course focuses on the application of mathematical statistics and the theory of probability in the field of IT. During the course, we are going to solve various assignments (henceforth, labs) and study specific algorithms. For example, the `LEV` algorithm for the finding of the number of actions (*insertion*, *replacement*, *deletion*) to be performed to correct the word. This algorithm is used in the word analysis to provide `Grammatical functionality` for the users to write correctly despite making mistakes. In other words, the program uses this algorithm to correct the user's words. 

## Discrete mathematics

To be continued.
